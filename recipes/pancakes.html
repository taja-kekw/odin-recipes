        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
        <h2>Pancake Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        </ul>
